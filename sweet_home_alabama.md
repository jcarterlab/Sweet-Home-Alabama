## **Summary**

The movie Sweet Home Alabama touches upon the tension between big city
life and somewhere that feels like home. But what if you could have the
benefits of a major city with less of the negative side effects? Are
some global cities better than others? This project uses data from a
range of sources to answer that question.

## **Method**

The z-score for each data distribution is calculated and multiplied by a
weight before being added together to get a total score. The weights are
determined by order of importance as follows:

 

##### Psychological factors

  - population density, sustainability and pollution  
  - weight = x3

##### Security factors

  - safety, stability and government effectiveness  
  - weight = x2

##### Physical factors

  - average wage, cost of living and hours of sun  
  - weight = x1
